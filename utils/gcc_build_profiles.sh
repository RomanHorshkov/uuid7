# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose
# -------
# Repository-ready GCC build profiles for a production-quality C project.
#
# This file is intentionally detailed. It serves two roles:
#
#   1. a reusable Bash fragment that exposes GCC, CPP, and LD flag arrays; and
#   2. a reference document describing why each flag is present, what trade-offs
#      it introduces, and where it should or should not be used.
#
# This version keeps preprocessor flags, compiler flags, and linker flags
# separate on purpose:
#
#   CPPFLAGS
#       Preprocessor-only policy: include roots, feature macros, project macros.
#
#   CFLAGS
#       Language mode, warnings, optimization, debug info, instrumentation.
#
#   LDFLAGS
#       Link-time policy: sanitizers, LTO, linker options.
#
# This file is designed to be copied into real projects. After copying it, the
# first thing you should edit is the project customization section:
#
#   - language standard;
#   - feature-test macros;
#   - include paths;
#   - profile lineup if the project has special needs.
#
# Intended usage
# --------------
# Source this file from your build script:
#
#   source ./gcc_build_profiles.sh
#
# Then select one profile:
#
#   gcc "${CPPFLAGS_DEBUG[@]}"    "${CFLAGS_DEBUG[@]}"    src/*.c -o app_debug \
#       "${LDFLAGS_DEBUG[@]}"
#
#   gcc "${CPPFLAGS_RELEASE[@]}"  "${CFLAGS_RELEASE[@]}"  src/*.c -o app_release \
#       "${LDFLAGS_RELEASE[@]}"
#
#   gcc "${CPPFLAGS_NATIVE[@]}"   "${CFLAGS_NATIVE[@]}"   src/*.c -o app_native \
#       "${LDFLAGS_NATIVE[@]}"
#
# Or print flags for command substitution:
#
#   gcc $(./gcc_build_profiles.sh print-cppflags sanitize) \
#       $(./gcc_build_profiles.sh print-cflags sanitize) \
#       src/*.c -o app_sanitize \
#       $(./gcc_build_profiles.sh print-ldflags sanitize)
#
# Or inspect a profile:
#
#   ./gcc_build_profiles.sh explain
#   ./gcc_build_profiles.sh print-cppflags debug
#   ./gcc_build_profiles.sh print-cflags native
#
# Design Principles
# -----------------
# Build configuration discussions often blur together concerns that should be
# evaluated independently. This file keeps them separate:
#
#   1. project customization
#      Language standard, feature macros, include roots, and project-local
#      defines. These are the first things you should edit after copy-paste.
#
#   2. warnings
#      Compile-time diagnostics. They do not make the final binary slower.
#      They can increase build noise and, if paired with -Werror, can make the
#      build more brittle across compiler versions. This file deliberately does
#      not enable -Werror by default.
#
#   3. instrumentation / hardening
#      Runtime checks or safety mechanisms inserted into the generated binary.
#      Examples include sanitizers, stack protectors, and _FORTIFY_SOURCE.
#      These may increase runtime cost and binary size.
#
#   4. optimization
#      Code-generation policy. Examples include -O1, -O2, -O3, -flto, and
#      -march=native. These affect runtime performance, binary size, debugging
#      quality, and sometimes whether latent undefined behavior becomes visible.
#
# The profiles below keep those concerns explicit:
#
#   debug
#       Friction-minimized debugger-oriented development profile.
#
#   audit
#       Compiler-driven validation profile with strong warnings and GCC static
#       analyzer. No runtime sanitizers.
#
#   sanitize
#       Runtime-defect hunting profile with ASan + UBSan + LSan.
#
#   release
#       Portable production profile with sensible hardening. This is the
#       default release configuration for software that must be fast without
#       abandoning baseline defensive measures.
#
#   native
#       Local-machine tuned release-like profile for benchmarking and local
#       validation, while still keeping hardening.
#
#   extreme
#       Maximum-performance local-machine profile. It intentionally removes some
#       safety and debugging features and is intended for benchmarking or tightly
#       controlled deployment, not for general distribution.
#
#   tsan
#       Optional dedicated ThreadSanitizer profile for concurrency analysis.
#
# Recommended workflow
# --------------------
#
#   1. Develop with: debug
#   2. Run compiler-centric cleanup with: audit
#   3. Run runtime bug hunting with: sanitize
#   4. Re-run the same tests with: release
#   5. Benchmark with: release and native
#   6. Use: extreme only when there is a concrete need to pursue the final
#      increment of performance
#   7. Use: tsan when auditing concurrent code
#
# Canonical Profile List
# ----------------------
# The ordered profile list is exported as a Bash array so build scripts can
# iterate over the same profile lineup without re-declaring it locally.
#
# Example:
#
#   source ./gcc_build_profiles.sh
#   for profile in "${GCC_BUILD_PROFILES[@]}"; do
#       ...
#   done
#
# Important Note
# --------------
# Passing the sanitize profile does not prove that the release, native, or
# extreme profiles are correct. Optimized builds can expose undefined behavior
# that did not manifest under sanitizer-heavy or debug-oriented builds. The same
# test suite should therefore be exercised under the optimized profiles as well.
#
# Compatibility Note
# ------------------
# This file targets GCC on Linux/glibc. Several flags are GCC-specific and may
# be unavailable in Clang, TinyCC, embedded cross-compilers, or older GCC
# releases. If the project must support multiple toolchains, add a small
# feature-detection or compatibility layer rather than weakening the policy
# globally.

#
# CPPFLAGS_BASE / CFLAGS_BASE
# ---------------------------
# These arrays define the project's baseline compilation contract.
#
# Keep the per-project customization here so the rest of the file can stay
# reusable across repositories.
#
# -std=c11
#     Compile as ISO C11.
#
#     Compile-time cost: none/minimal.
#     Runtime cost: none.
#     Risk: if you use GNU-only syntax, GCC may reject it unless the extension is
#           still accepted as an extension. With -Wpedantic, it will complain.
#
# -D_GNU_SOURCE
#     Expose GNU/glibc extensions in system headers.
#
#     This is useful for Linux systems programming: accept4, pipe2, O_TMPFILE,
#     memfd_create, pthread_setname_np, asprintf, etc.
#
#     Compile-time cost: none.
#     Runtime cost: none.
#     Portability: Linux/glibc-specific behavior becomes easier to depend on.
#
#     Alternative for stricter POSIX code:
#
#       -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L
#
#     Alternative if you knowingly want GNU C dialect:
#
#       -std=gnu11
#
# -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L
#     Request the POSIX.1-2008 interface set from libc headers.
#
#     This is a good default when you want a disciplined POSIX-oriented surface
#     without enabling the wider GNU extension namespace everywhere.
#
#     Compile-time cost: none.
#     Runtime cost: none.
#     Portability: generally better than _GNU_SOURCE, though still libc/platform
#                  dependent in the details.
#
#     Common reason to switch away from it:
#
#       - you need GNU/glibc-only APIs such as pipe2, accept4, memfd_create,
#         or asprintf and you want those prototypes exposed directly.
#

#     Add the current directory as an include root. In larger projects, a more

  #   object-size checks.
  #
  #   Requires optimization to be useful: -O1 or higher.

# Warning group 1a: day-to-day core warnings
# =============================================================================
#
# CFLAGS_WARN_CORE
# ----------------
# These warnings are broadly appropriate for day-to-day development. They are
# useful enough even in debug builds, and they are much less likely to stop you
# while you are still trying to get the code running.
#
# Runtime cost of all warning flags: none.
# Binary-size cost of all warning flags: none.
# Compile-time cost: usually tiny, except where explicitly noted.
#
CFLAGS_WARN_CORE=(
  # -Wall
  #   Enables GCC's common warning set. Despite the name, it does NOT enable all
  #   warnings. It catches many basic mistakes: suspicious control flow,
  #   unused variables, missing returns in many cases, bad printf usage, etc.
  -Wall

  # -Wextra
  #   Adds more useful warnings not included in -Wall. Examples: unused
  #   parameters in some contexts, missing field initializers in some cases,
  #   sign comparisons, etc.
  -Wextra

  # -Wpedantic
  #   Warn when using code that violates the selected ISO C standard.
  #   With -std=c11, this helps detect non-standard constructs.
  #
  #   Important: if the project enables GNU or POSIX feature-test macros,
  #   system headers and project code may intentionally use non-ISO APIs. That
  #   is fine. This warning mainly helps keep the language syntax honest.
  -Wpedantic

  # -Wformat=2
  #   Strong printf/scanf format checking. This includes extra checks beyond the
  #   default format warnings.
  #
  #   Catches wrong format specifiers, dangerous nonliteral formats in some
  #   cases, and security-sensitive formatting mistakes.
  -Wformat=2

  # -Wshadow
  #   Warn when a local declaration shadows another variable, parameter, global,
  #   or type depending on context.
  #
  #   Value: excellent for maintainability.
  #   Cost: no runtime cost.
  -Wshadow

  # -Wundef
  #   Warn if an undefined macro is used in an #if expression.
  #
  #   Example caught:
  #       #if FEATURE_X
  #   when FEATURE_X was never defined.
  #
  #   Safer style:
  #       #if defined(FEATURE_X) && FEATURE_X
  -Wundef

  # -Wreturn-type
  #   Warn about functions that should return a value but may not.
  #   Usually included by -Wall, kept explicit because it is critical.

# MARK: API Warnings
# Warning group 1b: external-symbol and API hygiene warnings
# =============================================================================
#
# CFLAGS_WARN_API
# ---------------
# These warnings are still "baseline good citizenship" for disciplined C, but
# they are more about API hygiene than about basic "let me get the program
# running" development. That is why debug does not force them.
#
CFLAGS_WARN_API=(
  # -Wmissing-prototypes
  #   Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype.
  #
  #   This is extremely useful in C. It catches accidental external functions
  #   that should have been static, and public functions missing from headers.
  -Wmissing-prototypes

  # -Wstrict-prototypes
  #   Warn about old-style prototypes like:
  #       int f();
  #   That does NOT mean "function with no parameters".
  #   It means "function with unspecified parameters".
  #
  #   Proper C prototype:
  #       int f(void);
  -Wstrict-prototypes

  # -Wold-style-definition
  #   Warn about K&R-style function definitions.
  #
  #   Modern C code should use prototype-style definitions only.
  -Wold-style-definition

  # -Wmissing-declarations
  #   Warn if a global function has no previous declaration.

  #   This overlaps somewhat with -Wmissing-prototypes, but it is still useful
  #   when trying to keep external symbols intentional.

# MARK: Strict Warnings
# Warning group 2: strict value/type/memory warnings
# =============================================================================
#
# CFLAGS_WARN_STRICT
# ------------------
# These warnings are highly valuable, but they require discipline. Adopting
# them often means introducing explicit casts, revisiting type choices, and
# tightening API design.
#
CFLAGS_WARN_STRICT=(
  # -Wconversion
  #   Warn for implicit conversions that may change a value.
  #
  #   Examples:
  #       uint32_t x = some_uint64;
  #       int i = some_size_t;
  #       uint8_t b = 300;
  #
  #   Value: excellent for serialization, binary formats, UUIDs, file sizes,
  #   indexes, wire protocols, endian code, and embedded targets.
  #
  #   Adoption cost: high. Intentional boundaries often require explicit casts.
  -Wconversion

  # -Wduplicated-cond
  #   Warn about duplicated conditions in if/else chains.
  #
  #   Example:
  #       if (x == 1) { ... }
  #       else if (x == 1) { ... }
  -Wduplicated-cond

  # -Wduplicated-branches
  #   Warn when two branches contain identical code.
  #
  #   Sometimes catches copy/paste bugs.
  #   Sometimes complains about deliberate symmetry.
  #   Good for test builds.
  -Wduplicated-branches

  # -Wlogical-op
  #   Warn about suspicious logical expressions.
  #
  #   Example classes: self-comparisons, always-true/false logic, duplicated
  #   operands. GCC-specific and occasionally noisy.
  -Wlogical-op

  # -Wnull-dereference
  #   Warn when GCC can prove a null pointer is dereferenced.
  #
  #   More effective with optimization enabled. No runtime cost.
  -Wnull-dereference

  # -Wsign-conversion
  #   Warn for implicit conversions that change signedness.
  #
  #   This is extremely useful in C because size_t/int mixing is a bug factory.
  #   It is also noisy until the codebase is disciplined.
  -Wsign-conversion

  # -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5
  #   Warn about switch cases that fall through without an explicit recognized
  #   annotation.
  #
  #   Level 5 is strict. Prefer the C attribute when available:
  #       __attribute__((fallthrough));
  #   or a project macro around it.
  -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5

  # -Wswitch-enum
  #   Warn when a switch over an enum does not handle all enum values.
  #
  #   Very useful for finite-state machines and typed status enums.
  #   Can be noisy if default is intentionally used for many enums.
  -Wswitch-enum

  # -Wswitch-default
  #   Warn when a switch does not have a default case.
  #
  #   Note: there is a style tension with -Wswitch-enum. For safety-critical-ish
  #   code, one common pattern is:
  #       - explicitly list all enum cases;
  #       - still have default for corrupted/out-of-range values.
  -Wswitch-default

  # -Wdouble-promotion
  #   Warn when float is implicitly promoted to double.
  #
  #   Useful in embedded/FP-heavy code. Less relevant for integer-only systems
  #   code. Can be noisy around printf because float arguments are promoted to
  #   double by the C calling convention for variadic functions.
  -Wdouble-promotion

  # -Wfloat-equal
  #   Warn when comparing floating-point values with == or !=.
  #
  #   Useful for numerical code, control code, simulation, and filters, where
  #   exact equality is often suspicious.
  #
  #   May be annoying if you intentionally compare against 0.0, NaN-handling
  #   patterns, or exact encoded values.
  -Wfloat-equal

  # -Wcast-qual
  #   Warn when a cast removes const or volatile qualifiers.
  #
  #   Very useful for API hygiene. Removing const is often a design smell.
  #   Removing volatile can be disastrous for MMIO/concurrency-ish code.
  -Wcast-qual

  # -Wcast-align=strict
  #   Warn when a cast may increase alignment requirements.
  #
  #   Example danger:
  #       uint8_t *p = ...;
  #       uint64_t *q = (uint64_t *)p;
  #
  #   On x86 this may merely be slower. On other architectures it may fault.
  #   Very relevant for portable C and embedded targets.
  -Wcast-align=strict

  # -Wwrite-strings
  #   Give string literals type "const char[N]" for warning purposes.
  #
  #   This catches code that tries to modify string literals or stores them in
  #   mutable char * pointers.
  -Wwrite-strings

  # -Wpointer-arith
  #   Warn about pointer arithmetic on void* or function pointers.
  #
  #   GNU C allows void* arithmetic as an extension.
  #   ISO C does not.
  #   Prefer uint8_t* / char* when doing byte addressing.
  -Wpointer-arith

  # -Wbad-function-cast
  #   Warn when a function call result is cast to an incompatible type.
  #
  #   Useful in C code with factory functions, integer/pointer conversion
  #   mistakes, or old-style APIs.
  -Wbad-function-cast

  # -Wstrict-aliasing=3
  #   Warn about code that may violate strict aliasing rules.
  #
  #   Important when using -O2/-O3 because GCC optimizes assuming strict
  #   aliasing by default.
  #   Many ugly type-punning tricks are undefined behavior.
  #
  #   Safer type-punning tools:
  #       memcpy
  #       unions only when used with care and compiler support
  #       explicit byte buffers
  -Wstrict-aliasing=3

  # -Wvla
  #   Warn on variable-length arrays.
  #
  #   VLAs can create unpredictable stack usage.
  #   For robust systems code, avoid
  #   them unless you have a very explicit reason.
  -Wvla

  # -Walloca
  #   Warn on alloca().
  #
  #   alloca() consumes stack dynamically and is hard to reason about.
  #   Avoid in robust systems code.
  -Walloca

  # -Wmissing-field-initializers
  #   Warn when aggregate initialization does not initialize every field.
  #
  #   Note: this can be annoying with idioms like {0}. GCC usually treats {0}
  #   specially, but designated initializers are often clearer:
  #       struct cfg c = { .mode = MODE_X, .size = 42 };

# MARK: Coverage Instrumentation
# Optional coverage instrumentation
# =============================================================================
#
# Coverage instrumentation is kept separate from the main profile lineup on
# purpose. It is not a "normal build profile" by itself. Instead, it is a
# composable extra that can be layered on top of another build when you
# explicitly want coverage data.
#
# Typical use:
#
#   - start from a base profile that represents the behavior you care about;
#   - add coverage instrumentation;
#   - build a derived variant such as release_cov.
#
# This keeps the reusable profile lineup clean while still making coverage
# support available to build scripts.
#
# CFLAGS_INSTRUMENT_COVERAGE / LDFLAGS_INSTRUMENT_COVERAGE
# --------------------------------------------------------
# --coverage is GCC's convenience switch for gcov-style instrumentation.
#
# In practice it enables the compile/link support needed to produce:
#   - .gcno files at build time;
#   - .gcda files when the instrumented code actually runs.
#
# Important:
#   - instrumentation must be present when compiling the code you want covered;
#   - link with --coverage as well so the gcov runtime support is included;
#   - coverage is usually meaningful on a debug-ish or release-ish build you
#     intentionally chose, not as a permanent always-on default.
#
# Runtime cost: noticeable.
# Binary-size cost: higher.
# Build-artifact side effects: produces .gcno/.gcda files.

  # -fstack-clash-protection
  #   Protects against stack clash attacks which involves exhausting the stack

  #   execution in some cases.
  
  # If the compiler emits code that adjusts the stack pointer by a huge amount at once:
  # - sub rsp, huge_size
  # then the program may jump over the guard page without touching it.
  # That is the “clash”: the stack can collide with another memory mapping.
  # What -fstack-clash-protection does
  # It changes stack allocation code so large stack growth happens page by page.
  # Conceptually, instead of:
  # - sub rsp, 1048576
  # the compiler emits something more like:
  # - loop:
  # -     sub rsp, 4096
  # -     touch [rsp]
  # -     repeat until enough stack allocated
  # So every memory page is touched while the stack grows.
  # If there is a guard page, the program hits it and crashes immediately instead
  # of silently jumping past it.

  # VLA
  # alloca()
  # large local arrays
  # deep recursion
  # parser code
  # decompression code

      Portable production profile: -O2, -DNDEBUG, strong warnings, and
      baseline hardening.

  native
      Local-machine tuned release-like profile: -O3, -flto, -march=native, and
      hardening still enabled.

  extreme
      Maximum-performance local-machine profile: -O3, -flto, -march=native,
      no frame pointer, no stack protector, and no fortify.

  tsan
      Optional ThreadSanitizer profile. Use separately from AddressSanitizer.
